# Damelyst - Where Safety Meets Direction

### Agentic AI for Safer Routes, Smarter Journeys

Damelyst is a multi-agent GeoAI platform that helps women compare routes using safety signals such as lighting, public activity, visibility, main-road quality, emergency proximity and recent verified incidents.
